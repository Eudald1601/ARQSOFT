# THEORY 
***USE CASES*** 

You will probably hear "user stories" (in scream) Use cases ARE NOT the same as user stories-Papers in Atenea that compare use case and user sotries. These is one, which provides rationale for still wron cases.

Internal definition set of ACTIONS (including the interactions between a user and the software system) that a software systems PERFORMS for ACHIEVING a SPEIFIC GOAL that BRINGS VALUE to the user.

SET OF ACTIONS strongly related with the contents of a use case 
1. ACTION 1
2. ACTION 2
3. ACTION 3

Types of actions:
- Performed by user
- Performed by the software system

Two types of use cases:
1. USER LEVEL use cases.
   - Where both, the user and the system perform some actions __(INTERACT)__
2. SUB-FUNCTION LEVER
   - Where there are ONLY actions __PERFORMED BY THE SYSTEM__

__Another informed definition:__

WRITEN STORIES on how some actor uses the software system under development for ACHIEVING a RELLEVANT GOAL for that actor and, consequenty, getting an ADDED VALUE.

WHAT WE (analyst) have to do with regards to the ue cases?

1. IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT USE CASES FRO THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM under development. Taking into account:
      - Diferent types of users
      - Identify the added values each type wants to get from the system <--> GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED by the system.
      - Name the use cases:
         - Short
         - Include a VERB
        
2. Build all the identified relevant use cases.
      - ORDERING THIS DEVELOPMENT
      - Start with the one thta concentrates the most relevant core goal.
      - While developing a use case, an analyst can identify another use case not previously identified. This means a 'tree' of use cases:

Worked EXAMPLE: CASE STUDY

Identification of use cases

Types of users: 
 - Player
 - Administrator

To identify the relevant interactions that a person who wants to use this system has to perform with that system.

Name: Play game

Number: 1 

ACTORS:
   - Players: persons that play the game.

BASIC FLOW: 
1. System gives turn to the right player
2. Player plays the turn
