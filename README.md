# THEORY 
***USE CASES*** 

You will probably hear "user stories" (in scream) Use cases ARE NOT the same as user stories-Papers in Atenea that compare use case and user sotries. These is one, which provides rationale for still wron cases.

Internal definition set of ACTIONS (including the interactions between a user and the software system) that a software systems PERFORMS for ACHIEVING a SPEIFIC GOAL that BRINGS VALUE to the user.

SET OF ACTIONS strongly related with the contents of a use case 
1. ACTION 1
2. ACTION 2
3. ACTION 3

Types of actions:
- Performed by user
- Performed by the software system

Two types of use cases:
1. USER LEVEL use cases.
   - Where both, the user and the system perform some actions __(INTERACT)__
2. SUB-FUNCTION LEVER
   - Where there are ONLY actions __PERFORMED BY THE SYSTEM__

__Another informed definition:__

WRITEN STORIES on how some actor uses the software system under development for ACHIEVING a RELLEVANT GOAL for that actor and, consequenty, getting an ADDED VALUE.
